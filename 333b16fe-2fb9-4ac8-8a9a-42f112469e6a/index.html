Yunior and Alex met in 2015 in Bilbao and most of you will have had a chance to meet and enjoy some time with us since then and see how we interact with each other &ndash; never a dull moment J. For those of you that have yet to meet our other half, we are almost opposites in so many ways, how we think and how we operate, but we make the best team ever when we are on best form. Always planning and dreaming of something to do, great food and the best cocktails, full of colour and panache. Our journey so far together has taken us to Brussels and Lanzarote and we are now about to embark on a new chapter in our lives together with our dog, Fred on the island of La Palma, where we will be slowly but surely basing ourselves more and more (but don&rsquo;t fret, we are not giving up on Brussels exactly just yet&mldr;)

We love each other hugely, for all sorts of reasons, we both thought that now was a good time to start married life together and we would love to share this day and indeed the days before and after the wedding with as many of you as possible."><p><strong>THE WEDDING:</strong></p><p>Thank you for showing interest in coming to our wedding. We know that many of you who decide that you can and want to come will have had to make quite an effort to get to La Palma and onto Puntagorda in the North West of the island, and for this we are delighted.</p><p>The date of the wedding and the party will be <strong>November 4 in Puntagorda, La Palma</strong>.</p><p>We want to have a fun, relaxed day and evening with our close friends and family, full of great food, drinks and lots of laughter.</p><p>We will start the afternoon in the village where we will be moving to, Puntagorda, and have the local Mayor officiate the wedding – assuming that the weather will be fine, we will be having this celebration at a local vantage point (venue and time to be confirmed). We would like this to be held in the afternoon, ideally at around 2 but we will let you know how things progress with the Ayuntamiento in the coming weeks.</p><p><strong>THE PARTY:</strong></p><p>After the official ceremony, we will most probably crack open a few drinks at the mirador and then slowly but surely head towards the venue where we will be hosting the wedding party. It is in the neighbouring village of Tijarafe, just before the main pueblo, up the mountain, looking out at the amazing sunsets on the west coast of the island. It is called Villa Corona.</p><p>We will arrange transport from the mirador to the villa, or indeed people can make their own way there by taxi or the local bus that goes on the hour (to and from Los Llanos de Aridane, Tazacorte, Tijarafe and Puntagorda). There are limited taxi opportunities – we understand that there are 1 or 2 taxi drivers in each village.</p><p>We will be starting the party with an adult afternoon tea, leading into savoury canapés and later in the evening a buffet and plenty of music later too. The themes will be very much La Palma and the Canaries, with plenty of influences from Spain, Britain and of course Cuba. When you RSVP to this invitation, we would be delighted if you would let us know of any dietary preferences and allergies so that we can find something for everyone to enjoy at the party.</p><p>We have yet to arrange this, but we hope to sort a bus to leave from the villa to Puntagorda and then to various stops along the main road to Los Llanos via Tazacorte, so that you don’t need to worry about transport at the end of the evening. Your best solution then would be to get the bus to Puntagorda earlier on Friday morning and then head back on the bus to the villa with us that we will organise etc…</p><p>Some people have asked about the dress code, and we would simply ask you to come in what you feel comfortable in and or feel is appropriate for a sub-tropical wedding. We want you all to feel relaxed and enjoy the party, meeting each other and all amongst the beautiful scenery of La Palma, la isla bonita. It should be warm and pleasant by day – around 23c normally but the evenings will be more chilly, around 15c or so at their coldest, so it’s best to have summer clothes but some extra layers for later.</p><p><strong>ACCOMODATION:</strong></p><p>Some of you will be staying at the villa which we are renting from November 2 to November 7 (and we will be contacting you about this in a separate message) otherwise, we would recommend that you look at the following options for places to stay. Before doing so, please get in touch with Alex or Yunior first for some advice and also on availability at our villa for any of the time.</p><p>Obviously, <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb.com</a> have great options for holiday homes (and less so actual people’s home in the case of La Palma), and <a href="http://www.trivago.com/">Trivago</a> as well more for hotels.</p><p>Be careful when you book to check the actual place where the booking is – many of these sites will give distance as the crow flies, forgetting mountain passes and the like, and also giving the broader local authority area rather than the actual pueblo itself…</p><p><strong>Areas that are close enough:</strong></p><p>PUNTAGORDA / TIJARAFE / TAZACORTE and LOS LLANOS DE ARIDANE</p><p><strong>But do not stay in the following</strong> – they are too far away from the wedding and the party:</p><p>GARAFIA / EL PASO / FUENCALIENTE / LAS MANCHAS / SANTA CRUZ / PUNTALLANA / BARLOVENTO</p><p>To get a perspective on the distances – it is technically only 15km from Los Llanos to Puntagorda or Tijarafe Pueblo but it will take the best part of 40mins to get there…</p><p>The best luxury on the island would be at the Hacienda de Abajo or Las Norias both in Tazacorte. Other accommodation in Tazacorte pueblo or Puerto will be warm as well (it is the sunniest and warmest place in all of Spain) as it is on the west coast and at sea level.</p><p>Tijarafe and Puntagorda don’t have hotels but lots of villas and bed and breakfasts and loads of charm. They are also closer for the Alpine walks and trails to the Roque de los Muchachos, almost 2500m above sea level and possibly will be covered in the first snows of the season by then.</p><p><strong>THE ISLAND</strong></p><p>La Palma is nothing like much that you might expect from the Canary Islands – it is stunningly beautiful, full of colour, with the most insane topography and diverse climatic zones from roadside flowers not out of place in Ireland, Alpine trails as you would expect in Switzerland, Caribbean colonial architecture similar to Cuba or Guatemala, tropical fruits and flowers as in Thailand and the only foreign voices that you will hear are the Germans on walking holidays – even with the hype, most of you will find yourself stunned at the beauty and tranquillity of the place and all the more crazy given how small the island actually is.</p><p>The drawback to all of this is that it takes an age to get anywhere – even with a hire car, you will need at least an hour and a bit to get to Puntagorda, if not more if you stop off and admire the beauty of it all (A MUST IS TO STOP AT EL TIME at the top of the Baranco de Angustias when you head up from Tazacorte / Los Llanos de Aridane towards Tijarafe. Have a coffee, an hojaldre con miel or a rosquete and sit back and relax – you made it up THAT pass!!)</p><p>The north west of the island (so anything north of Los Llanos) didn’t have proper drivable roads until the 1960s, so everything was delivered on a well-maintained network of terraces, bridlepaths and basic caminos and often the only way was by boat to the tiny coves and up very steep cliff walks to the villages situated between 700m and 1000m above sea level in the sub-tropical Mediterranean zone. These caminos are part of walkers paradise and will take you from the coast to the top of the mountain volcanoes.</p><p>The island is on three levels, the coast which is very much tropical – Santa Cruz, the airport, Las Indias, Puerto Naos and Tazacorte, but the coast is not very accessible and most of the island is perched high up on clifftops. Most of the island is between 500m-1000m above sea level. The middle zone is more like the Med but probably a bit drier and less cold in the winter. The tops of the island are Alpine and pretty fresh! The wind blows mostly on the east of the island and less so on the west which has more sun as well. Sadly the beaches are not white (when you come across any) but black. The beaches at Tazacorte and Puerto Naos are swimable and quite pleasant.</p><p>Other activities to consider if you are coming for a few days:</p><p>The island is an amazing and it would be a real shame just to come to the wedding and not combine a few days on the island or combine with a trip to Tenerife etc if you want to make it a bit more of a family holiday. But La Palma for all its beauty and relaxed vibe means a bit more planning and little bit of hassle… sorry!</p><p>If you are coming earlier than November 2, you might want to spend a day or two based in or around Santa Cruz de la Palma. The town is very cute, perched up and down a few spines of the mountains going down into the sea. It’s like a mini-Funchal crossed with Dartmouth if that makes any sense to anyone!</p><p>Taking your car and heading off around the island will offer you plenty to see and a lot of variety. The whole island in one day would be a huge undertaking and you would be best to split the island in at least 2 or 3 days to do it justice and not get bored by the curves in the road. It can be quite tiring so take your time and enjoy plenty of stops as you go.</p><p>The part from Santo Domingo to Barlovento is stunning and good for a stroll around. The mountain trip from just before Santo Domingo up to the Roque de los Muchachos and down to Santa Cruz is a long long undertaking and will take you about 2h to go up and come down, but the views on a sunny day are great and well worth it. You can walk around at the top of the Roque too.</p><p>The Puntagorda trails and caminos above the village look like they defy gravity, but you can keep going and going further and further into the clouds and beyond. It is amazing that you will see vineyards even at 1500m above sea level. Perfect for walking and driving. The views are out of this world, like looking at the sunshine above the clouds on a plane.</p><p>From Tijarafe to Puntagorda and from Los Llanos to Tazacorte, it is full of banana plantations, avocado trees and the odd citrus. The land is full of curves and big drops as the road curves around the various ‘barancos’ which are the ravines from the volcano to the sea. Further north the land gets steeper and a bit wider allowing for some pastures and goat herding, and various vineyards. It looks almost like the moors of the west country or coastal rugged pastures of the West Country in England, but just a lot warmer and there is always the odd cactus and palm tree to outwit you.</p><p>Wine tours of some of the vineyards (particularly in the north of the island around Garafia where the land becomes rugged and is higher up, and thus at this latitude better as the cooler air helps make wine less sweet) can be made at various bodegas.</p><p>There is also a lovely vegan café perched high up a cliff but in the depths of ‘middle earth’ around Santo Domingo / Las Tricias in Garafia. The lady at Café Aloe has made a great little eccentric space with flowers and great views. Perfect if you are out and about for a wander.</p><p>Walking, hiking and strolling around the Taburiente National Park is impressive but you will need a full day for it. The access past much of El Paso is only for those willing to experience everything on foot by themselves. You will however be rewarded with some of the most outstanding nature.</p><p>Star gazing – the island is mostly in a starlight reserve. Drive up to the top of the Roque at night and sit there on the plateau of the mountains and turn off your lights – you will see the milky way and plenty of other intergalactic marvels – the world’s most renowned observatories are up there too – it’s the best vantage point in the world to see the stars!</p><p>Whale watching – from various ports on the island offer trips. We are not yet sure whether November is the time of year for prime-time whales watching, but a google search might give you some pointers there.</p><p>Eating and drinking – the island is more about agriculture than it is tourism, although that is beginning to change. The best of the produce – pineapples, bananas, avocadoes, mangoes are all locally produced and although small, are deliciously sweet and flavoursome. The goat cheese is usually eaten fresh and smoked and often pan-fried like haloumi.</p><p>The standard for food is lower than you might expect from the gastronomy that Spain is now well-known for. The food is never bad, but given the wealth of produce available on the island from small producers it is woeful that so much of this is not made available in innovative or extremely well executed local specialities. That said, our favourite restaurant in Puntagorda – El jardin de los naranjeros is super charming and as in most places, go for the fish of the day and the croquettes and her salads and you are in for a treat J The restaurant at the lighthouse at the tip of Fuencaliente is doing a more gourmet twist using local ingredients but such stylised offerings are rare.</p><p>La Palma makes its own rum and cigars from tobacco growing on the island. The bananas appear everywhere, even in drinks and in potato crisps alternatives. The islanders make a great aguadente that most bars will infuse themselves with wild fennel and other herbs – be careful when trying this stuff – it will take your head off! Puntagorda has a farmers market on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings. Other town halls have similar markets on other days of the week as well. The avocadoes are amazing but you need to ripen them with local bananas for a few days in a paper bag!</p><p><strong>TRANSPORT</strong></p><p><strong>LA PALMA’s airport code is SPC – it is not Las Palmas or Palma!!!</strong></p><p>There are direct flights from London Gatwick on Tuesdays and Saturday and the prices were very reasonable recently – at around €90 at last glance, rtn. These are with Easyjet. Thomson fly from Manchester on Thursdays also direct.</p><p>There are direct flights from Brussels on Saturdays with Jetairfly and with Transavia from Amsterdam on Mondays and Fridays, and from Dusseldorf on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays, almost daily from Berlin with AirBerlin, all direct.</p><p>Do remember that if you can get on one flight with Easyjet, Ryanair, Air Berlin etc… say to Berlin or Gatwick or Madrid and then come from those places – you wont see it as a through connection for luggage etc but the prices could well be much better value…</p><p>Dublin – Gatwick (with ryanair) and then Gatwick to La Palma (easyjet) comes in at around €140pp</p><p>Brussels-Madrid *ryanair-La Palma – with Vueling or Iberia can come in at around €150pp</p><p>Brussels-Berlin(Easyjet) – Berlin-La Palma (Easyjet / Air Berlin) can come in as well at around €185 and you can have more flexibility on the dates of travel.</p><p>Other alternatives are to fly to Gran Canaria, or Tenerife South and get a ‘hopper’ flight with <a href="http://www.canaryfly.com/">Canaryfly</a> or with <a href="http://www.binter.com/">Binter</a> to La Palma. Please note that the most of the flights will go from Tenerife North than from South or from Las Palmas Gran Canaria. From South to North isn’t difficult on Tenerife and there are direct buses between both airports but just bear this in mind when and if you book the flights from Tenerife North to La Palma. Most European flights to Tenerife will fly to Tenerife South.</p><p>The cheapest and easiest options however if you can not get a direct flight and want to interconnect your luggage, are to get a flight with Vueling or Iberia from most places in Europe via Madrid or occasionally via Bilbao or Barcelona. This will mean sometimes spending the day or evening in Madrid, but if you are up for that (it need not be a total pain as with 6h stopover or more you can do worse than enjoy a few canas or a glass of wine or even a café con leche on the plaza mayor) – and you can get some good deals on a place to stay in Madrid on trivago or airbnb and this need not be so bad as a connection or way to spend the time to get to La Palma.</p><p>Those of you with time on your hands or a disklike of hopper planes can look at all sorts of ferry combinations. There is a weekly ferry leaving Lanzarote Arrecife at 0100 Wednesday evening, that stops in Las Palmas at 0800 and leaves again at 1400 on Thursday, docks at Tenerife at Santa Cruz at around 1700 and leaves again at 2300, that arrives into La Palma on Friday at 0800 in Santa Cruz de la Palma. You can get off the boat at each of the ports and Santa Cruz de Tenerife is a lovely vibrant city – and the cabins are very good value. You can see the options via <a href="https://www.trasmediterranea.es/en/">Trasmediterranea</a> – two people with a bed each in a private cabin, is €48pp from Santa Cruz de Tenerife.</p><p>The good news however, is when you get to La Palma, the car hire is cheap and I would recommend that you look to book through <a href="carhire3000.com">carhire3000.com</a> and you will find cars available from about €9 per day. A piece of advice – get your excess waiver insurance through the operator when you arrive – some will not ask for you to pay premium and those that do will offer a more conclusive and fairer and cheaper policy than that online. Ryanair are notorious difficult on this front we have found out in Lanzarote, much to our chagrin.</p><p>So as you can see, you can get there (it’s a bit of a pain in the ass but it’s all quite pleasant really) and if you can focus on making the voyage part of your holiday and make a stopover out of necessity we can for sure offer some great places to pass the time in Madrid, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Berlin, or London!</p><p><strong>GIFTS:</strong></p><p>We really would like you all to just come and enjoy, that’s the aim of all of this. We have both got most of the things that we want or need in our lives, so please don’t get anything. It is an absolutely huge undertaking for many of you to get to La Palma on November 4 - particularly for those without direct flights or even through connections, so we really want you to focus on trying to get to the island for at least a couple of days.</p><p>We really hope quite a few of you will be able to make it. The island is exceptionally beautiful and the people lovely – we are all quite a good bunch of fun folks too and the fun and games should be all worthwhile.</p><p><strong>Alex and Yunior</strong></p><p><strong>August 2016.</strong></p><p> Ϟεോ_fi�</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="50"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="52"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="53"><span data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="56"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="57"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="60"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
