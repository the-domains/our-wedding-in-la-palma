Yunior and Alex met in 2015 in Bilbao and most of you will have had a chance to meet and enjoy some time with us since then and see how we interact with each other – never a dull moment J. For those of you that have yet to meet our other half, we are almost opposites in so many ways, how we think and how we operate, but we make the best team ever when we are on best form. Always planning and dreaming of something to do, great food and the best cocktails, full of colour and panache. Our journey so far together has taken us to Brussels and Lanzarote and we are now about to embark on a new chapter in our lives together with our dog, Fred on the island of La Palma, where we will be slowly but surely basing ourselves more and more (but don’t fret, we are not giving up on Brussels exactly just yet…)

We love each other hugely, for all sorts of reasons, we both thought that now was a good time to start married life together and we would love to share this day and indeed the days before and after the wedding with as many of you as possible.</p></div><a class=" " href="333b16fe-2fb9-4ac8-8a9a-42f112469e6a" data-reactid="64"><!-- react-empty: 65 --></a><!-- react-empty: 66 --><!-- react-empty:
